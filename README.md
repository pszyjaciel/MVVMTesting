# MVVMTesting

The repository can be use to test the MVVM pattern without any GUI connected to it.
The purpose for this test project it to stay away from the real Windows 10 GUI code, 
as the compiling and deploying of the GUI will take several time. 
Actually socket and serial port has been almost implemented, so the working code can be
attached now to the real Win10 GUI app.

Further I imagine to make Unittest working on this code.
